Hi!

My name is Alex. Thank you for taking me into consideration for the role!

I will take you through the changes I have done for the page.

Changes I have done: 

1. First of all, since the first task was "Your goal is to redesign the look and feel while keeping its functionality intact" and I felt like I had some freedom regarding the thematic of the page. Since the thematic of the company is "Waste", I have thought of the green transformer from Transformers who was a Waste car, can't remember its name.Having this in mind, I thought U would like to give it a more industrial look, going for this color thematic and effects. I feel like it looks good, while also keeping the structure and functionality and the rigurousity of the example design.

2. I think that the selection of the card is the biggest improvement that I have come up with. From what I can see, on the example page, there is this kind of "Select" and "Selected" button while also keeping an almost unseenable checkmark on the top right corner of the card, which I feel is not so good for the user experience. Even though I know this kind of select and selected mechanism is a general practice, I don't really like it in a was, since you also click on the whole card anyway, not only on the button. So the improvement I came up with was to remove the button totally and increase the selection outline and checkmark visibility, while also adding some interesting lighting and animation on the selection, such as the zoom on the skip picture when placing the cursor on the card. 
Even though I made these changes, I really like the footer modal, it looks really nice, so I kept it, but I added more information inside it.

3. On the card, there is this badge which shows the number of yards. I moved it to left, because in on the first card, the badge appears over the waste in the image, not only in the background, and I felt like I wanted to move to left.


4. I changed the design of the "Not allowed on the road" label, making it more emphasized, while keeping the respecting the thematic that I have chosen.
